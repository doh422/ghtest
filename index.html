			<h3>What makes Beverly Hills MD Dark Spot Corrector different from other products?</h3>

			<p><span class="highlight">Beverly Hills MD Dark Spot Corrector</span> uses gentle, nourishing ingredients that do not cause irritation, dryness, flaking, or clogged pores.</p>

			<p><span>Beverly Hills MD Dark Spot Corrector</span> contains rare, sophisticated ingredients that can help reduce the look of discoloration without causing unwanted side effects. These ingredients are:</p>
			<ul>

				<li><span class="ingredient">DermalRX (Yeast Extract)</span>: This ingredient works as an exfoliant that provides a non-irritating resurfacing effect. It is an excellent alternative to chemical peels for its ability to provide a more radiant overall complexion.</li>
				<li><span class="ingredient">Daisy Flower Extract</span>: This natural extract acts as an effective skin lightener, reducing the appearance of all types of dark spots without any harsh bleaching action.</li>
